<h2>Hi, I am Shawn! 👋 </h2>

<p> ...and I am on a mission to create beautiful, engaging websites.

Currently serving as a Software Engineer II at Vertafore, I specialize in building robust, scalable applications using modern technologies including React, TypeScript, and .NET Framework. My expertise spans full-stack development, with particular strengths in front-end architecture, API design, and cloud-native solutions. I thrive in collaborative environments where I can leverage my technical skills alongside my background in management and real estate to deliver exceptional user experiences and drive business value.

Throughout my career, I've demonstrated a unique ability to bridge technical complexity with user-centric design, ensuring that every solution not only meets functional requirements but also exceeds user expectations. My experience in client-facing roles has honed my ability to translate business needs into elegant technical solutions, while my leadership background enables me to mentor junior developers and contribute to team growth.

Let's build something beautiful together. </p>
